## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED

### Issue 1: Route Conflicts
**Problem**: All variant route groups were trying to serve `/`  
**Solution**: Moved variants from route groups to actual paths
- `(productivity)` → `productivity/`
- `(student)` → `student/`
- `(enterprise)` → `enterprise/`
- `(creative)` → `creative/`
- Kept `(marketing)` for root `/`

### Issue 2: Tailwind CSS v4 Beta Errors
**Problem**: Tailwind v4 beta causing "Cannot convert undefined or null to object" errors  
**Solution**: Downgraded to stable Tailwind v3.4
- Removed `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin
- Updated `app.css` to use v3 syntax
- Added `postcss.config.js`
- Updated `vite.config.ts`

### Issue 3: Package.json Scripts
**Problem**: Scripts using `bunx` but Bun not installed  
**Solution**: Updated scripts to use `npm`/`vite` directly
