## üîí Privacy & Security

### How does local processing work?
AhFai uses Ollama to run AI models directly on your device. Your conversations, notes, and data are stored in a local database that only you can access.

### Can you see my data?
No. Absolutely not. Your data is stored locally on your device. We have no servers collecting or storing your personal information.

### Is my data encrypted?
Yes. All data is encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption. Your passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 12 rounds.

### What about GDPR/CCPA compliance?
Since we don't collect any data, we're automatically compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations. Your data never leaves your device.

### Can I export my data?
Yes! You can export all your data in JSON format at any time from the settings page.

### What happens if I delete my account?
All your local data is permanently deleted. Since we don't have cloud backups, this action is irreversible.
